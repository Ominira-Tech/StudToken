Brazilian student ID

Currently in Brazil, the benefit of half-price tickets is offered to encourage the presence of students in cinemas and other cultural events such as concerts. In order to access this benefit, students must present a student ID, which needs to be periodically renewed and is known as a "carteirinha." These student IDs incur a cost for issuance and renewal. The major problem is that, due to the significant discount they offer, these IDs are often counterfeited, resulting in losses for businesses and discomfort for students who actually possess genuine IDs. While there are some institutions in the country that offer ID issuance, none of them are completely counterfeit-proof and all come with a cost.
Therefore, we propose StudToken, a dApp based on Arbitrum, focused on the Brazilian market, aimed at modernizing the process of issuing and validating student IDs. To start off, we propose a project that will offer a course to a class of 25 students from different schools, providing training on blockchain, crypto assets, and Arbitrum. Subsequently, this will generate a pilot model of the student ID with these students. The training aims to popularize the technology, which is still relatively unknown to the general population, and the student ID will demonstrate one of the many practical uses of this technology.


The project is currently in the initial phase looking for investments. Get in touch to contribute or find out more
